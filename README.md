# PhenoExpression
Phenotypes and Gene Expression Project

This project aims to link genotype, gene expression as well as the organism's phenotype by:

* Investigating differential gene expression in KO and WT mice in different physiological systems. 
* Exploring gene expression and viability in different mice embryonic stages. 
* To link human gene expression and phenotype. 
* To compare disease and non-disease related genes and their expression in tissues as well as comparing gene expression between human and mice orthologs.
